   <div>
        Python is a popular high-level programming language that is easy to learn and widely usedin various
        domains such as web development,data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific  computing.
        It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, and its namewas inspired by the Monty Python comedy
        group. Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line by line without 
        needing to be compiled beforehand. It also has a dynamic type system,which means that variables don't 
        need to be declared with a specifictype before use.Python is known for its simplicity and readability, 
        thanks to its clean syntax and use of indentation to define blocks of code. It has a large and active 
        community, which has contributed to the creation of many libraries and frameworks that make it easier
        to use Python for various purposes.Some of the popular libraries and frameworks in Python include  NumPy
        for numerical computing, Pandas for data analysis, Django for webdevelopment, and TensorFlow for machine
        learning. Python can be run on various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.
